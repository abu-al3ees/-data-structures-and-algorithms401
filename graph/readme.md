# Graphs
is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge
Implement Graphs and related methods. Implement getEdges function that returns true or false for whether a specified path through the graph is possible. Implement depthFirst function to do preorder traversal on a graph.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Created Vertex, Edge, and Graph classes and constructors
- Created methods for addVertex(vertex), addEdge(startVertex, endVertex, weight), getNeighbors(vertex)
